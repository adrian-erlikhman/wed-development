# CollabNotes: Real-Time Markdown Editor

## Project Description
A collaborative note-taking app with real-time editing and markdown support, similar to Google Docs. Multiple users can join a session and edit documents simultaneously.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- React
- WebSockets with Socket.IO
- Node.js backend
- MongoDB for data storage

## Setup & Installation
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js and npm
   - MongoDB database
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd collabnotes-markdown-editor
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. **Deployment**
   Deploy the app to Node-friendly services such as Heroku, Railway, or Render. Configure environment variables and use `npm start` to run the production build.

## Core Features
- User authentication
- Live collaboration via WebSockets
- Markdown syntax highlighting
- Autosave and version history

## Development Roadmap
1. Set up Express server with Socket.IO
2. Build React frontend with editor component
3. Implement real-time synchronization logic
4. Add authentication and user sessions
5. Store documents and versions in MongoDB
6. Deploy and test collaborative sessions

## Expected Results
Users can create notes, invite others, and collaborate in real time with markdown formatting and version history.

## Future Improvements & Research
- Offline editing with conflict resolution
- Rich text and code block support
- Integration with cloud storage providers
