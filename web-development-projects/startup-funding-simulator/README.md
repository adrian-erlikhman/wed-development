# Startup Funding Simulator

## Project Description
An interactive tool for founders to simulate how equity, valuation, and cap tables evolve across funding rounds. It uses drag-to-adjust interfaces for investor stakes and shows dynamic graphs as values change.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- React
- Typescript
- Zustand or Redux for state management
- math.js for calculations

## Setup & Installation
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js and npm
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd startup-funding-simulator
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. **Deployment**
   Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or another hosting solution. Configure environment variables if needed and use `npm start` to serve the production build.

## Core Features
- Real-time calculations of equity and dilution
- Persistent data using local storage
- Draggable controls for adjusting investors and valuations
- Dynamic graphs for cap table changes

## Development Roadmap
1. Set up React + Typescript project
2. Implement state management with Zustand/Redux
3. Build computation logic using math.js
4. Add interactive UI elements and graphs
5. Persist data to local storage
6. Polish UI and deploy

## Expected Results
Founders can test different investment scenarios and instantly see how their cap table evolves, improving understanding of equity dynamics.

## Future Improvements & Research
- Export cap tables to CSV or PDF
- Scenario comparisons and summaries
- Collaboration features for multiple users
- Integration with real fundraising data APIs
